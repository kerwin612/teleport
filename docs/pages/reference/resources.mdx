title: Teleport Resource Reference
description: Reference documentation for Teleport resources

This reference guide lists dynamic resources you can manage with Teleport. For
more information on dynamic resources, see our guide to [Using Dynamic
Resources](../management/dynamic-resources.mdx).

Examples of applying dynamic resources with `tctl`:

```code
# List all connectors:
$ tctl get connectors

# Dump a SAML connector called "okta":
$ tctl get saml/okta

# Delete a SAML connector called "okta":
$ tctl rm saml/okta

# Delete an OIDC connector called "gworkspace":
$ tctl rm oidc/gworkspace

# Delete a github connector called "myteam":
$ tctl rm github/myteam

# Delete a local user called "admin":
$ tctl rm users/admin

# Show all devices:
$ tctl get devices

# Fetch a specific device:
$ tctl get devices/<asset-tag>

# Fetch the cluster auth preferences
$ tctl get cluster_auth_preference
```

<Admonition type="note">
  Although `tctl get connectors` will show you every connector, when working with an individual connector you must use the correct `kind`, such as `saml` or `oidc`. You can see each connector's `kind` at the top of its YAML output from `tctl get connectors`.

## List of dynamic resources

Here's the list of resources currently exposed via [`tctl`](./cli.mdx#tctl):

| Resource Kind | Description |
| - | - |
| [user](#user) | A user record in the internal Teleport user DB. |
| [role](#role) | A role assumed by interactive and non-interactive users. |
| connector | Authentication connectors for [Single Sign-On](../access-controls/sso.mdx) (SSO) for SAML, OIDC and GitHub. |
| node | A registered SSH node. The same record is displayed via `tctl nodes ls` |
| cluster | A trusted cluster. See [here](../management/admin/trustedclusters.mdx) for more details on connecting clusters together. |
| login_rule | A Login Rule, see the [Login Rules guide](../access-controls/login-rules.mdx) for more info. |
| device | A Teleport Trusted Device, see the [Device Trust guide](../access-controls/device-trust/guide.mdx) for more info. |
| [ui_config](#ui-config) | Configuration for the Web UI served by the Proxy Service |
| cluster_auth_preference | Configuration for the cluster's auth preferences. |

## User

Teleport supports interactive local users, non-interactive local users (bots)
and single-sign on users that are represented as a resource.

```yaml
kind: user
version: v2
metadata:
  name: joe
spec:
  # roles is a list of roles assigned to this user
  roles:
  - admin
  # status sets user temporarily locked in a Teleport system, for example
  # when users exceed predefined amount of failed login attempts
  status:
    is_locked: false
    lock_expires: 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z
    locked_time: 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z
  # traits are key, list of values pairs assigned to a user resource.
  # Traits can be used in role templates as variables.
  traits:
    logins:
    - joe
    - root
  # expires, if not empty, sets automatic expiry of the resource
  expires: 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z
  # created_by is a system property that tracks
  # identity of the author of this user resource.
  created_by:
    time: 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z
    user:
      name: builtin-Admin
```

## Role

Interactive and non-interactive users (bots) assume one or many roles.

Roles govern access to databases, SSH servers, Kubernetes clusters, web services and applications and Windows Desktops.

(!docs/pages/includes/role-spec.mdx!)

## Login Rules

Login rules contain logic to transform SSO user traits during login.

(!docs/pages/includes/login-rule-spec.mdx!)

## Device

Device contains information identifying a trusted device.

(!docs/pages/includes/device-spec.mdx!)

## UI config

Global configuration options for the Web UI served by the Proxy Service. This resource is not set by default, which means a `tctl get ui` will result in an error if used before this resource has been set.

(!docs/pages/includes/ui-config-spec.mdx!)

## Cluster maintenance config

Global configuration options for the agents enrolled into automatic updates.

(!docs/pages/includes/cluster-maintenance-config-spec.mdx!)

## Cluster auth preferences

Global cluster configuration options for authentication.

```yaml
metadata:
  name: cluster-auth-preference
spec:
  # Sets the type of second factor to use.
  # Possible values: "on", "off", "otp", "webauthn" and "optional".
  # If "on" is set, all 2FA protocols are supported.
  second_factor: "otp"

  # The name of the OIDC or SAML connector. if this is not set, the first connector in the backend is used.
  connector_name: ""

  # webauthn is the settings for server-side Web authentication support.
  webauthn:
    # rp_id is the ID of the Relying Party.
    # It should be set to the domain name of the Teleport installation.
    #
    # IMPORTANT: rp_id must never change in the lifetime of the cluster, because
    # it's recorded in the registration data on the WebAuthn device. If the
    # ri_id changes, all existing WebAuthn key registrations will become invalid
    # and all users who use WebAuthn as the second factor will need to
    # re-register.
    rp_id: teleport.example.com
    # Allow list of device attestation CAs in PEM format.
    # If present, only devices whose attestation certificates match the
    # certificates specified here may be registered (existing registrations are
    # unchanged).
    # If supplied in conjunction with `attestation_denied_cas`, then both
    # conditions need to be true for registration to be allowed (the device
    # MUST match an allowed CA and MUST NOT match a denied CA).
    # By default all devices are allowed.
    attestation_allowed_cas: []
    # Deny list of device attestation CAs in PEM format.
    # If present, only devices whose attestation certificates don't match the
    # certificates specified here may be registered (existing registrations are
    # unchanged).
    attestation_denied_cas: []

  # Enforce per-session MFA or PIV-hardware key restrictions on user login sessions.
  # Possible values: true, false, "hardware_key", "hardware_key_touch"
  require_mfa_type: "off"

  # Sets whether connections with expired client certificates will be disconnected.
  disconnect_expired_cert: false

  # Sets whether headless authentication is allowed.
  # Headless authentication requires WebAuthn.
  # Defaults to true if webauthn is configured.
  allow_headless: false

  # Sets whether local auth is enabled alongside any other authentication
  # type.
  allow_local_auth: true

  # Sets whether passwordless authentication is allowed.
  # Requires Webauthn to work.
  allow_passwordless: false

  # Sets the message of the day for the cluster.
  message_of_the_day: ""

  # idp is a set of options related to accessing IdPs within Teleport. Requires Teleport Enterprise
  idp:
    # options related to the Teleport SAML IdP.
    saml:
      # enables access to the Teleport SAML IdP.
      enabled: true

  # locking_mode is the cluster-wide locking mode default.
  # Possible values: "strict" or "best_effort"
  locking_mode: best_effort

  # default_session_ttl defines the default TTL (time to live) of certificates
  # issued to the users on this cluster.
  default_session_ttl: "12h"

  # The type of authentication to use for this cluster.
  # Possible values: "local", "oidc", "saml" and "github"
  type: local

version: v2
```
