Teleport supports four editions. In this guide, we will help you determine
which edition is most appropriate for your use case.

## Editions

### Teleport Team

Teleport Team makes it easier for small organizations to get started enabling
secure access to their infrastructure. It includes a subset of Teleport
Enterprise Cloud features, and teams can switch to Teleport Enterprise Cloud as
they scale up.

### Teleport Enterprise Cloud

Our team at Teleport manages the Auth and Proxy Services, giving you a running
Teleport cluster where you can configure RBAC, set up Single Sign-On connectors,
and register resources by deploying additional Teleport services.

### Teleport Enterprise

A self-hosted Teleport deployment for security-conscious organizations.

secure access to databases, Windows desktops, Kubernetes clusters, and more.
